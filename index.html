<br>

<h4>Training: 
 <ul>
  <li>Dumbbells for athelticism, Machines/Cables for hypertrophy and bodybuilding, Barbell is good mix of both and for power/olympic lifting
  <li>Control eccentric and isometric (concentric control doesn't matter as much), Also don't use momentum to compensate heavy weights
  <li>Understand difference between types of sets
  <li>High reps for hypertrophy low reps for strength
  <li>Rest days are very important don't skip (unless you train like a *cat emoji* then ig skip rest days)
  <li>Progressive overload and mechanical tension (fuck the pump)
  <li>Warm up to be literally warmer (temperature affects performance)
 </ul>
 
 <br>

<h4>Alcohol: 
 <ul>
  <li>Don't drink the same day or day after training (exercising breaks down muscles and alc will be processed first delaying MPS)
  <li>Alcohol increases cortisol and estrogen levels (and decreases T)
  <li>Still have a good time tho and be moderate
 </ul>

<br>

<h4>Physiology: 
 <ul>
  <li>Know the function of each muscle you wanna train
  <li>Know how to activate each muscle (practice flexing in the mirror no joke)
  <li>Follow the fibers when training (use basic physics)
 </ul>
 
<br>

<h4>Fat Loss: 
 <ul>
  <li>Lose subcutaneous fat by caloric deficit
  <li>Only do light cardio after working out if any (15 min) cuz cardio can be catabolic
  <li>Do HIIT for visceral fat loss
  <li>Fats don't necessarily make you fat
  <li>Can't spot reduce fat
  <li>To show abs lower bf%
  <li>Abs #-pack is genetic
  <li>Bloating/bloated abs is caused by gut microbiome (SCFAs) & diet (foods broken down release gas) and eat lots of fibers, Don't eat super large meals in any one sitting, Don't use a low-FODMAP diet long-term, Eat prebiotic foods
 </ul>

<br>

<h4>Supplements/Diet: 
 <ul>
  <li>Eat 0.8g protein per lb at least
  <li>Creatine Monohydrate (can't get naturally ez and has been thoroughly studied)
  <li>Pre-Workout (avoid DMAA/DMHA)
  <li>Ashwaganda (I don't use this but has been proven to boost T and strength and *brown flexing emoji*)
  <li>Turmeric (*brown flexing emoji*)
 </ul>

<br>

<h4>Misc Tips: 
 <ul>
  <li>Anabolic window doesn't exist
  <li>Learn benefits of cold/hot showers
  <li>Learn terms & phrases - DOMS, RPE, Anabolic, Androgenic, etc.
  <li>Listen to science and studies, not anecdotes from juicers
  <li>Stay natural unless you're competing (hormones, organ health, and it's basically cheating)
 </ul>
  
<br>
