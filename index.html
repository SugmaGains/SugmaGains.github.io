-Sports/Run/Walk
-Stairmaster
-Farmer's Walk

<br>

Training: Dumbbells for athelticism, Machines/Cables for hypertrophy and bodybuilding, Barbell is good mix of both and for power/olympic lifting, Control eccentric and isometric (concentric control doesn't matter as much), Also don't use momentum to compensate heavy weights, Understand difference between types of sets, High reps for hypertrophy low reps for strength, Rest days are very important don't skip (unless you train like a *cat emoji* then ig skip rest days), progressive overload and mechanical tension (fuck the pump)

Alcohol: Don't drink the same day or day after training (exercising breaks down muscles and alc will be processed first delaying MPS), Alcohol increases cortisol and estrogen levels (and decreases T), Still have a good time tho and be moderate

Physiology: Know the function of each muscle you wanna train, Know how to activate each muscle (practice flexing in the mirror), Follow the fibers when training (use basic physics), and Eat 0.8g protein per lb at least

Fat Loss: Lose subcutaneous fat by caloric deficit, Do HIIT for visceral fat loss, Only do light cardio after working out if any (15 min) cuz cardio can be catabolic, Fats don't necessarily make you fat, Can't spot reduce fat, To show abs lower bf%, Abs #-pack is genetic, Bloating/bloated abs is caused by gut microbiome (SCFAs) & diet (foods broken down release gas) and eat lots of fibers, Don't eat super large meals in any one sitting, Don't use a low-FODMAP diet long-term, Eat prebiotic foods

Supplements: Creatine Monohydrate (can't get naturally ez and has been thoroughly studied), Pre-Workout (avoid DMAA/DMHA), Ashwaganda (I don't use this but has been proven to boost T and strength and *brown flexing emoji*), Turmeric (*brown flexing emoji*)

Fitness Influencers (and what I use them for):
MPMD: Supplements & Pharmacology
Athlean-X: Physiology & Injury Science
CaylePT/JPGCoaching: Exercises
Sean Nalewanyj/Jeff Nipard: General Advice/Science
Dorian Wilson/Dr. Idz: Science/Studies

Misc Tips: Anabolic window doesn't exist, Stay natural unless you're competing (hormones, organ health, and it's basically cheating), Learn benefits of cold/hot showers

Learn terms & phrases - DOMS, RPE, Anabolic, Androgenic, etc.

Listen to science and studies, not anecdotes from juicers
